                <span class="">Learn about Joanna Helander, a photographer, writer, and filmmaker born in Ruda Slaska in 1948.

                </span>
				<span>
				Her early contacts with Poland's democratic opposition led her to direct a festival of independent Polish culture in Sweden in 1981, and she went on to publish books of photography and translations of Polish poetry. She has also directed and produced several films based on her own photographs. Joanna Helander's work has appeared in publications and television programs in Poland, Germany, and the U.S.A.
